The key use cases of this app are:

1. On the go, you hear about a cool place to visit. Quickly log it so we can find it later
2. Keep track of restaurants that we hear are good, or liked in the past, etc., so that we can find good restaurant recommendations for a situation in the future: eg, I'm going to be going to a Broadway show, let me find a good restaurant for beforehand that's within a 15 minute walk
3. For vacations: let me build out a map of where I'm heading to help me figure out where to eat or go, and also I can use on the go to find nearby places that I had flagged
4. I need to find a place near me right now. Let me look around where I am and filter my curated list of good places to find something that fits what I'm looking for
5. I'm planning an upcoming date night, so I don't have many constraints. Let me look at my list of new places that I've heard about (and maybe tagged date-night)
6. I need a cool place to go to dinner next Tuesday — what places have available reservations or are walk-in only?

The app should be optimized for these use cases.
